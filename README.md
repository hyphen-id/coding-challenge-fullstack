# Hyphen Fullstack Coding Challenge

Hey ðŸ‘‹! Congratulations on getting to coding challenge stage.

The purpose is to allow you to get hands-on and write some actual code, which we will review and discuss during your technical interview.

The goal is build a small React application where a user can chat with an AI through a simple UI.

## Functional Requirements
* A user should be able to type messages into a text box and see their messages appear in a conversation view.

* When a user sends a message, the application should call the OpenAI API, which will respond as if it were a chatbot. The responses should be displayed in the conversation view.

* The conversation view should clearly differentiate between messages from the user and responses from the API, perhaps by differentiating the color or side of the screen for each.

Feel free to add other relevant functionalities if you want and have time.

## Technical Requirements
* You must use React for the user interface and TypeScript. You are free to use any other libraries you are comfortable with.

* The application must call the OpenAI API, you can use the API token: `XXX`

* You should handle errors gracefully and inform the user when something goes wrong.

* Your code should be clean, well-organized, and easy to understand.

* We're not expecting a masterpiece of design, but the app should look acceptable to a non-technical user. There should be some attempt at styling, feel free to use whatever framework/tools youâ€™re familiar with.

## Practical

* Please don't spend more than 60-90 minutes on this exercise. This is meant to be a starting point for our technical discussion and does not need to be a fully polished, production-ready application. You can note the things you would have done if you had more time and we can discuss it during the interview if you like.

* Share with us your git repo link, at the latest 24 hours before your interview (Github usernames: @simonwh @pax-k)

Have fun!
